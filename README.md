# Invaders

Invaders is an open source terminal arcade game with audio, based off of the "Space Invaders" classic arcade game.

From the [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0).

Since the original presentations, folks continue to tinker and improve the game. Feel free to fork this repository, make a change, and submit a pull request if you have a good idea!
